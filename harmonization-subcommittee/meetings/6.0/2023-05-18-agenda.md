## Add SBOM definition to Cyber Domain [(#19)](https://github.com/niemopen/niem-model/issues/19)

Add SBOM = "Software Bill of Materials" to cyber domain appinfo:LocalTerm to be on par with the other acronyms defined there.

## Add hs:Wages element [(#13)](https://github.com/niemopen/niem-model/issues/13)

Human Services defines a hs:WagesType with a lot of wage info. Human Services has been requested to create an element for this type and to add it to a new augmentation for person employment information so this wage info can be easily leveraged.

## Incorrect section character in several Screening enumerations [(#16)](https://github.com/niemopen/niem-model/issues/16)

Four enumerations in scr:ChargeCategoryCodeSimpleType have a question mark in the definition where a section character is expected.

## Consider adding pronouns to nc:PersonType [(#15)](https://github.com/niemopen/niem-model/issues/15)

The new Contact form for the updated WhiteHouse.gov site has added support for personal pronouns (for gender specification). This may become a trend for government agency websites in the future.

## Refactor nc:EmployeeAssignmentAssociation ([#14](https://github.com/niemopen/niem-model/issues/14))

Move nc:EmployeeRegistrationAbstract and nc:EmployeeSupervisorIndicator elements to nc:EmploymentAssociationType so that they can be used as part of EmploymentAssociation and/or the EmployeeAssignmentAssociation. This is consistent with the previous movement of other elements from nc:EmployeeAssignmentAssociationType to nc:EmploymentAssociationType.

## Replace empty CBRN CaseMetadata and DataFileMetadata elements ([#24](https://github.com/niemopen/niem-model/issues/24))

CBRN defines two metadata elements, cbrn:CaseMetadata and cbrn:DataFileMetadata, which are both of type structures:MetadataType. This type is meant to be used as a parent type and not the type of a property, and the NDR is being updated accordingly for 6.0.
